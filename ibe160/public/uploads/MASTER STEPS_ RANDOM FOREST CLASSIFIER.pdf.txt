MASTER STEPS: RANDOM FOREST CLASSFIER
To train a model using Random Forest in Python, you can follow these basic steps using the
scikit-learn library:
1. 	Import Necessary Libraries:
python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
2. 	Load and Prepare the Data:
Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. For this example, let's assume you have a CSV
file:
python
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
3. 	Select Features and Target Variable:
Identify the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) you want to
predict.
python
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']] # Replace with your actual feature names
y = data['target'] # Replace with your actual target variable name
4. 	Split the Data into Training and Test Sets:
Divide the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.
python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
5. 	Initialize and Train the Random Forest Model:
Create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class and fit it to the training data.
python
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
6. 	Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
7. 	Evaluate the Model:
Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and
classification report.
python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print('Confusion Matrix:')
print(conf_matrix)
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print('Classification Report:')
print(class_report)
Þ These steps provide a basic workflow for implementing Random Forest in Python
using scikit-learn.
Þ You can adjust parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and others to optimize
the model for your specific dataset and requirements.
