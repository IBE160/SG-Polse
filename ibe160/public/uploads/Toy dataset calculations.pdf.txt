The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is the core measure used in linear regression:
Where:
• 	yi= actual value
• 	y^i = predicted value from the line
• 	n = number of data points
It measures the total squared distance between the actual points and the predicted line.
• 	Smaller SSE = line fits better.
• 	The “best fit line” in ordinary least squares (OLS) is the one that minimizes SSE.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
• 	Take each residual
• 	Make it positive by taking the absolute value,
• 	Average them over all data points.
Interpretation: “On average, how far off are our predictions?”

-- 2 of 3 --

Example: If MAE = 3 in exam scores, predictions are off by ~3 marks on average.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
• 	Square each residual (bigger errors get punished more),
• 	Average them,
• 	Take the square root.
Interpretation: “Typical error size, but with big mistakes counted extra.”
Example: If RMSE = 4 in exam scores, then the typical prediction error is about 4 marks, but
large mistakes are weighted more than small ones.
Fit comparison (lower is better)

Predictions for two new points (using the three candidate
lines)
Candidate lines:
• 	Line A
• 	Line B
• 	Line C
New points: Hours studied: 0.5 hours, 5.5 hours, What will be the prediction for the new
points? If we use lines A,B,C?
