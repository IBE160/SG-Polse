Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook
(Beginner’s Guide)
1. What’s a Jupyter Notebook?
• 	An interactive document (with .ipynb extension) combining code, output, and
narrative.
• 	Ideal for data exploration, learning Python, and sharing results.
• 	Runs locally in your browser via a "kernel" (e.g., Python).
2. How to Install
• 	Using Anaconda (recommended for beginners):
o 	Download Anaconda distribution.
o 	Install using default options (includes Python, Jupyter, and key libraries).
• 	Using pip (if you already have Python installed):
• 	pip install jupyter
3. Launching the Notebook
• 	Anaconda: Open via Anaconda Navigator or the desktop shortcut.
• 	Terminal / Command Prompt:
• 	jupyter notebook
• 	Jupyter opens in your default browser at http://localhost:8888/tree.
• 	Click New → Python 3 to create a notebook.
4. Basic Concepts: Cells & Kernel
• 	Cells: Building blocks—two types:
o 	Code cells: For writing/running Python.
o 	Markdown cells: For text (formatted using Markdown).
• 	Kernel: The engine that executes your code.

5. Your First Steps
1. 	In a code cell:
print("Hello, world!")
Run using Ctrl + Enter (Win/Linux) or ⌘ + Enter (Mac).
2. 	Try another code cell:
import time
time.sleep(3) 	# watch the [*] while it runs
3. 	Notice the execution label: In [1], In [2], etc.—shows order of execution.
6. Editing vs. Command Mode & Shortcuts

-- 2 of 4 --

• 	Edit mode (green border): Type into a cell.
• 	Command mode (blue border): Manage cells.
• 	Useful shortcuts (when in command mode):
o 	A / B → insert cell Above / Below
o 	M → change to Markdown
o 	Y → change to Code
o 	DD → delete cell (press “D” twice)
o 	Z → undo last cell deletion
o 	Ctrl + Enter → run cell, stay
o 	Shift + Enter → run cell, move to next
o 	Alt + Enter → run cell, insert new below
7. Using Markdown Cells
• 	Press M, then type:
# Project Title
**Bold**, *italic*, `inline code`
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
1) Step one
2) Step two
• 	Run (Shift+Enter) to render.
8. Mini Data Example
In a new code cell:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.DataFrame({
"year": [2021, 2022, 2023, 2024],
"value": [10, 14, 9, 18]
})
df
Then plot:
df.plot(x="year", y="value", kind="line")
plt.title("Demo Trend")
plt.show()
(Anaconda includes libraries; if needed: pip install pandas matplotlib.)
9. Save, Rename, and Navigate
• 	Rename: click the notebook name (top-left).
• 	Save: use menu File → Save & Checkpoint or the save icon.

• 	Dashboard view: manage, rename, open, or shut down notebooks via the Running
tab.
10. Export & Share
• 	Export via File → Download as… (e.g., HTML, PDF).
• 	Share on GitHub and view/read via nbviewer.
• 	Jupyter runs locally unless you intentionally upload/share the notebook.
11. Troubleshooting Tips
• 	If a cell stays at In [*]: use Kernel → Restart.
• 	To clean up execution state: use Kernel → Restart & Run All.
• 	Change cell type if needed: press M (Markdown) or Y (Code).
• 	If files don’t appear, start Jupyter from the right directory or adjust its start location.
12. Good Practices
• 	Only run notebooks from trusted sources.
• 	Keep data files in the same folder or use relative paths.
• 	Write headings and comments for clarity and reproducibility.
