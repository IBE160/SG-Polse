MASTER STEPS: RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
To train a model using a Random Forest Regressor in Python, you can follow these basic
steps using the scikit-learn library:
1. 	Import Necessary Libraries:
python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
2. 	Load and Prepare the Data:Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. For this
example, let's assume you have a CSV file:
python
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
3. 	Select Features and Target Variable:Identify the independent variables (features)
and the dependent variable (target) you want to predict.
python
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']] # Replace with your actual feature names
y = data['target'] # Replace with your actual target variable name
4. 	Split the Data into Training and Test Sets:Divide the data into training and test sets
to evaluate the model's performance.
python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
5. 	Initialize and Train the Random Forest Regressor Model:Create an instance of
the RandomForestRegressor class and fit it to the training data.
python
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
6. 	Make Predictions:Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
7. 	Evaluate the Model:Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean
Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
python
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R-squared: {r2}')

Þ These steps provide a basic workflow for implementing a Random Forest Regressor
in Python using scikit-learn.
Þ You can adjust parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and others to optimize
the model for your specific dataset and requirements.
