What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree is a model that makes decisions by asking a series of questions — just like
humans do when classifying something.
Each question splits the data into groups based on the most useful feature (the one that
separates the classes best).
🦁 vs 🐯 Example — Lion or Tiger?
Imagine we want to teach a computer to tell the difference between a lion and a tiger.
We have data like this:
Animal Has Stripes Weight (kg) Mane Species
Lion 	No 	190 	Yes 	Lion
Tiger 	Yes 	220 	No 	Tiger
Lion 	No 	180 	Yes 	Lion
Tiger 	Yes 	200 	No 	Tiger
How does the tree decide the first question (the “best split”)?
The goal is to choose the question that best separates lions from tigers.
Possible first questions:
1. 	“Is weight > 150 kg?”
2. 	“Does it have stripes?”
3. 	“Does it have a mane?”
Now, all lions and tigers weigh more than 150 kg — so that question doesn’t help separate
them.
But the question “Does it have stripes?” perfectly splits the animals:
• 	If Yes → Tiger
• 	If No → Lion
So, the best splitting question is “Does it have stripes?”, not “Does it weigh more than
150 kg?”

The Resulting Decision Tree
[Has stripes?]
/ 	\
Yes 	No
[Tiger] 	[Lion]
Key Idea:
1. 	The model sees examples of lions and tigers.
2. 	It tests which feature best separates them.
3. 	It finds that “Has_Stripes” gives a perfect split — all tigers have stripes, all lions
don’t.
4. 	The resulting tree will have:
[Has stripes?]
/ 	\
Yes 	No
[Tiger] 	[Lion]
A Decision Tree always chooses the feature that gives the clearest separation between
groups — the one that reduces impurity (or confusion) the most.
Summary
• 	Decision Trees work by asking questions that split data clearly.
• 	The first (root) question is the most powerful one.
• 	In our example, “Has stripes?” is a better split than “Weight > 150 kg?” because it
cleanly separates tigers from lions.
• 	Decision trees automatically choose the best splitting feature based on data.
• 	The “best” feature is the one that gives the cleanest separation (lowest impurity).
• 	In this case, “Has Stripes” is far more useful than “Weight”.
