📑 Synthetic E-Commerce Retail Dataset —
Description
This dataset simulates transactions from an online retail company.
It was designed with built-in missing values, outliers, categorical variables, and numeric
features so that we can practice preprocessing techniques.
🔢 Dataset Overview
• 	Rows: 1000 transactions
• 	Columns: 22
• 	Includes: User info, order details, product features, engagement metrics, and derived
business KPIs
• 	Teaching features: MCAR/MAR/MNAR missingness, outliers, categorical encodings
(nominal + ordinal), variables for scaling
🗂 Columns & Details
Identifiers
• 	order_id (int) → Unique transaction ID (100000–101000)
• 	user_id (int) → Customer identifier (repeat customers possible)
Customer & Session Info
• 	device_type (categorical: nominal)
§ 	Values: Mobile, Desktop, Tablet
§ 	Device used for browsing.
• 	traffic_source (categorical: nominal)
§ 	Values:
o 	Organic → Arrived via unpaid search (SEO, Google results)
o 	Paid → Clicked on paid ads (Google Ads, social ads)
o 	Email → Clicked from email campaigns/newsletters
o 	Referral → Came from other websites/blogs/forums
o 	Direct → Typed URL/bookmark directly
o 	Social → From social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok)
• 	country (categorical: nominal)
§ 	Values: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, UK, USA
§ 	Used to differentiate domestic vs international orders.
• 	is_member (categorical: binary)
§ 	Values: Yes, No

§ 	Whether customer is enrolled in loyalty program.
• 	loyalty_tier (categorical: ordinal)
§ 	Values: None < Bronze < Silver < Gold < Platinum
§ 	Only meaningful for members; non-members mostly None.
Engagement Metrics
• 	session_length_min (float) → Total browsing session length (minutes). Some MCAR
missingness. Includes: Time when the browser tab is open, even if the user is idle.
• 	time_on_site_min (float) → Active time spent on site in session.Excludes: Long
idle/inactive periods when no clicks or scrolls happen.
• 	pages_viewed (int) → Number of pages viewed.
Order Details
• 	product_category (categorical: nominal)
§ 	Values: Electronics, Apparel, Home, Books, Beauty
§ 	Each has distinct price distributions.
• 	price (float) → Unit price, depends on product category.
• 	discount_pct (float) → Discount applied (0–60%).
§ 	More missing for Organic traffic (MAR).
• 	quantity (int) → Units purchased (1–4 normal, 20–60 outlier bulk orders).
• 	revenue (float) → Derived as price × quantity × (1 - discount_pct).
§ 	A few extreme outliers (wholesale/erroneous).
Customer History
• 	days_since_last_purchase (float) → Recency of last purchase. Members buy more
often; random MCAR missingness.
• 	customer_tenure_months (float) → How long the customer has been with the
platform.
§ 	MNAR-like: non-members less likely to provide tenure.
Feedback & Returns
• 	rating (float) → Customer satisfaction rating (1–5).
§ 	Some missing (MCAR) and a few invalid outliers (0, 6).
• 	return_rate_pct (float) → % of items historically returned. Mostly low (~8%), with
outliers 50–95%.

Logistics
• 	shipping_cost (float) → Delivery fee. Lower for domestic, higher for international.
Outliers at ~120.
• 	delivery_time_days (float) → Delivery time (days). Domestic ~3, international ~7.
Outliers 20–40.
Fraud
• 	fraud_flag (binary int) → 1 if fraudulent transaction, else 0. About 2% positive.
🎯 Why this dataset is useful
• 	Missingness: MCAR (session_length_min), MAR (discount_pct), MNAR
(customer_tenure_months)
• 	Outliers: Injected
in quantity, revenue, shipping_cost, return_rate_pct, delivery_time_day
s, rating
• 	Categorical variety:
§ 	Nominal: device_type, traffic_source, product_category, country, i
s_member
§ 	Ordinal: loyalty_tier
• 	Scaling candidates: Continuous skewed vars (revenue, price, shipping_cost) +
count vars (quantity, pages_viewed)
This makes it an ideal sandbox for practicing EDA, feature engineering, and preprocessing
pipelines.
