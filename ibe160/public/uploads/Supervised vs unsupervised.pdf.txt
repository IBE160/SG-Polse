Machine Learning: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is when computers learn from data — instead of being programmed
with fixed rules.
We give data to the machine, and it finds patterns or makes predictions based on that data.
1. Supervised Learning
Definition: In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data — which means we
already know the answers (output values).
Think of it like a teacher supervising the learning process.
Example:
Hours Studied 	Marks Scored
2 	40
4 	60
6 	80
The model learns the relationship between “hours studied” (input) and “marks scored”
(output). Later, it can predict marks for a new student who studied 5 hours.
Common Algorithms:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Used for:
Predicting sales, prices, or scores (Regression)
Classifying emails as spam or not spam (Classification)
2. Unsupervised Learning
Definition: In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled — there are no answers given. The
model has to find patterns or groups on its own.
It’s like giving students a bunch of puzzle pieces without showing them the final picture.
Example:

Imagine you have customer data — age, income, and spending — but no labels.
The algorithm can group customers with similar behavior together (e.g., high-income big
spenders, low-income minimal spenders).
Common Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Used for:
Customer segmentation
Market basket analysis
Detecting anomalies or patterns
Feature 	Supervised Learning 	Unsupervised Learning
Data 	Labeled (known output) 	Unlabeled (unknown output)
Goal 	Predict outcomes 	Find hidden patterns or groups
Example 	Predict house prices 	Group customers by buying habits
Type of Problems 	Classification & Regression 	Clustering & Association
Supervised Learning → Like learning with an answer key.
Unsupervised Learning → Like exploring without a map to find patterns yourself.
