The Challenge of Digit Recognition: MNIST Dataset
Ambiguity in Data
Our goal: create an AI system that can automatically identify these digits, despite their variations and sometimes ambiguous appearance s.
The MNIST dataset contains thousands of handwritten digit images with their corresponding labels (0-9).

Why Rule-Based Systems Fail
The 1980s Approach
Traditional AI in the 1980s used "expert systems" with manually
written rules:
• If black pixels form a single loop → digit is 0
• If black pixels form two intersecting loops → digit is 8
• If black pixels form a vertical line in the middle → digit is 1
Problems
This approach fails for several reasons:
• Extremely laborious to write comprehensive rules
• Requires precise definitions of vague terms like "mostly," "loop,"
"middle"
• Handwritten digits vary widely, requiring countless exceptions
• Results in poor performance despite enormous effort

ML: What is it?
• Machine learning involves designing automated systems that uncover
hidden patterns in data to help make smart decisions.
• This concept is inspired by how the human brain learns from the
information it receives from the environment.

The Big Four Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning
Learns from labeled examples with known
outcomes
Unsupervised Learning
Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data
Semi-Supervised Learning
Uses small labeled data with large
unlabeled datasets
Reinforcement Learning
Learns through trial and error with
rewards/penalties
Each approach solves different problems and has distinct applications in the AI ecosystem.

Supervised Learning: Learning with a Teacher
Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled datasets where each input has a corresponding correct output.
The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs.
Key Tasks:
• Classification:
Categorizing inputs (spam detection, medical diagnosis)
• Regression:
Predicting continuous values (house prices, temperature
forecasting)

Machine Learning Tasks
1. Classification (Predicting Categories)
Classification assigns items to predefined labels .
Postal Mail Sorting (Posten
Norge)
Classifies addresses into delivery zones
(e.g., Oslo vs. Trondheim vs. Tromsø).
Healthcare (Helse Norge)
Classifies whether a medical image (like
a mammogram) shows cancer or no
cancer.
Banking (DNB)
Classifies a transaction as fraudulent or
legitimate.

2. Regression (Predicting Continuous Values)
Regression predicts numerical outcomes across Norwegian sectors:
Eiendom (Real Estate)
Predicts the price of a house in Oslo based on size,
location, year built, and number of bedrooms.
Statens vegvesen (Roads & Traffic)
Predicts daily traffic volume on the E6 highway
depending on time of year, weather, and weekday.
Meteorologisk institutt (Weather Service)
Predicts temperature or rainfall amount in
Bergen tomorrow.

Unsupervised Learning: Discovering
Hidden Patterns
How It Works
Algorithms analyze unlabeled data to identify inherent structures, patterns, and
relationships without predefined categories or outcomes.
Key Techniques
• Clustering: Grouping similar data points (customer segmentation, image
compression)
• Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data while preserving information (feature
extraction)
Customer segmentation by purchasing behavior without predefined groups

3. Clustering (Finding Natural Groupings)
Clustering groups data without predefined labels, revealing natural patterns:
Tourism (Visit Norway)
Clusters tourists into groups (e.g.,
hikers, city visitors, northern
lights seekers) based on travel
behavior.
Retail (Rema 1000)
Clusters customers by shopping
patterns (e.g., families with kids,
students, health-focused shoppers).
Education
Clusters Norwegian schools by
performance indicators (attendance,
exam scores, student-teacher ratio).

Semi-Supervised Learning: The Best of Both Worlds
Semi-supervised learning bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised
approaches by using:
• Small amounts of labeled data (expensive to obtain)
• Large amounts of unlabeled data (inexpensive and abundant)
Perfect For:
Tasks where labeling is expensive, time-consuming, or requires experts, such as:
• Medical image analysis
• Speech recognition with limited transcriptions

Reinforcement Learning: Learning by
Trial and Error
Agent
AI system that makes decisions (robot, game player, trading
algorithm)
Environment
World the agent operates in (game, simulation, real-world
setting)
Rewards
Feedback signals that guide learning (points, profit, task
completion)
Example: AlphaGo mastered the ancient game of Go by playing millions of
matches against itself, learning optimal strategies through reward signals.
