Random Forest
What is a Random Forest?
A Random Forest is like a team of many decision trees working together.
Each tree makes its own prediction, and the forest takes a majority vote (for classification)
or average (for regression).
Think of it as “wisdom of the crowd” — instead of trusting one decision tree, we trust many
trees and let them decide together.
How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. 	Create many decision trees — each tree gets a slightly different random sample of
the data (this is called bagging).
2. 	Each tree learns patterns independently (like “Has stripes?”, “Has mane?”, etc.).
3. 	All trees vote on the final answer.
4. 	The majority vote wins — this gives better accuracy and avoids overfitting.
🦁 vs 🐯 Example
Let’s say we again want to predict whether an animal is a lion or a tiger, based on features
like:
Has Stripes Has Mane Weight (kg) Animal
0 	1 	190 	Lion
1 	0 	220 	Tiger
0 	1 	180 	Lion
1 	0 	200 	Tiger
• 	Tree 1 might decide: “Has stripes?” → Tiger
• 	Tree 2 might decide: “Has mane?” → Lion
• 	Tree 3 might use both “Weight” and “Has stripes”
When we show a new animal:
• 	Tree 1 → Tiger
• 	Tree 2 → Tiger
• 	Tree 3 → Lion
Majority vote = Tiger

The Random Forest predicts: Tiger
Why Use Random Forest?
Feature 	Decision Tree 	Random Forest
Simplicity Easy to understand 	A bit complex
Stability 	Can overfit easily 	More stable and accurate
Accuracy 	Depends on one tree 	Combines many trees for better performance
Analogy 	One person’s opinion Group decision (majority wins)
Summary
• 	Random Forest = many trees + random sampling + voting
• 	Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy
• 	Works well for both classification (like lion vs tiger) and regression problems
