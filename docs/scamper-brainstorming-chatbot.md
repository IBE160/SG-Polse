# SCAMPER Brainstorming Session: Course-FAQ Chatbot

## Session Overview

This document summarizes the ideas generated during a SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to Other Uses, Eliminate, Reverse) brainstorming session for the Course-FAQ Chatbot project. The primary goal for interactability was identified as 'ease of use'.

## Ideas Generated

### S - Substitute

*   **Idea**: Substitute a purely AI-driven conversation with pre-defined categories.
    *   **Rationale**: Enhances ease of use without oversimplifying.
    *   **Responsibility**: Defining and updating categories would fall under the responsibility of teachers and TAs.
    *   **Structure**: Categories can be structured by type (e.g., 'technical questions', 'research').

### C - Combine

*   No specific combinations were identified as necessary for this project at this time.

### A - Adapt

*   **Idea 1: Proactive Suggestions**
    *   **Mechanism**: Based on the student's current course progress, when students ask about something that can be expanded on, or on something related to an upcoming deadline.
*   **Idea 2: Contextual Memory**
    *   **Mechanism**: The chatbot should remember context within a single session.

### M - Modify

*   **Tone of Voice**: Should be encouraging.
*   **Information Presentation**: A combination of bullet points and paragraphs.
*   **Feedback Mechanism**: Does not need to be more granular than thumbs up or down.

### P - Put to Other Uses

*   **Identify Common Areas of Confusion**: Use chatbot data to pinpoint topics students struggle with.
*   **Training Tool**: Utilize the chatbot's knowledge base or interaction logs to train new TAs.

### E - Eliminate

*   **Manual Search for Course Documents**: Eliminate the need for students to manually search for course documents by having the chatbot directly access and parse them.

### R - Reverse

*   No specific reversals were deemed necessary for this project at this time.
